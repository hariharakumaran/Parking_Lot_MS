# Parking_Lot_MS
Objective:
  •	The main objective of the project is to design a system that supports multiple vehicle types, levels, and concurrent entry/exit operations while ensuring real-time tracking of spot availability.
  
Description:
  •	Developed a multi-level Parking Lot Management System supporting cars, bikes, and trucks with type specific parking spot allocation and release. 
  •	Implemented design patterns – Singleton (centralized parking manager), Factory (vehicle creation), and Observer (real-time spot availability updates for display boards and apps).
  •	Enabled concurrent access across multiple entry/exit points, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and real-time tracking of parking spot availability.
